weight: 30

Mixer has been [removed from Istio since 1.8 release](/news/releases/1.8.x/announcing-1.8/#deprecations).
Migration is needed if you are still rely on Mixer built-in adapter or out-of-process adapter for mesh extension.

For built-in adapters, several alternatives are provided:

* `Prometheus` and `Stackdriver` adapters are replaced by telemetry v2 and implemented as [proxy extensions](/docs/reference/config/proxy_extensions/).
  Customization of telemetry generated by these two extensions can be achieved via [request classification](/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/classify-metrics/).
* `Memquota` and `Redisquota` adapters are replaced by the [Envoy based rate limiting solution](/docs/tasks/policy-enforcement/rate-limit/).
* `OPA` adapter is replaced by the [Envoy ext-authz based solution](/docs/tasks/security/authorization/authz-custom/), which supports [integration with OPA policy agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-authorization/).

For out-of-process adapter, Wasm based extension can be used. Please refer to the guides about [Wasm module development](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/wasm-extensions/blob/master/doc/write-a-wasm-extension-with-cpp.md) and [distribution](/docs/ops/configuration/extensibility/wasm-module-distribution/).
